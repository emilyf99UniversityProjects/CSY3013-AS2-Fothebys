## Introduction
This project was completed as Part of Year Three of BSC Software Engineering at the University of Northampton.

It was part of the module CSY3013 - Software Engineering 3 and was an assessment on

This project was weighted for 50% of the module grade. The other 50% was assessed using an Exam with Essay Style Questions, so the other half of this module is not on GitHub.

This module assessed the student's ability to extract information from clients, as well as their software engineering Elicitation and Analysis. The final part of the module assessed the student's ability to build a prototype of the first sprint for the client. 

## Brief (Client Introduction) 
Fotheby’s is an international auction house specialising in the sale of fine art. In the current buoyant art market Fotheby’s wishes to computerise its inventory to provide a fast and effective search mechanism for its many clients.

Fotheby’s currently employ a clerical inventory system for all auction-related records. They also produce a printed catalogue of items for sale at each auction, which is distributed to its clients in advance of the sale or on the day of the auction. This catalogue is the company’s primary method for advertising what items will be presented at each auction, but many clients have complained that as the distribution is limited (approximately 5000 copies of the catalogue are produced for each auction) moving to a web-based auction catalogue would significantly increase interest in the items being sold and implicitly allow for the achievement of higher final sale prices. 

In the current system, all auction items are currently classified into five categories; these are paintings, drawings, photographic images, sculptures and carvings. These are the only categories of art that the auction house currently sells on behalf of its customer base. Again, this is seen as a significant limitation by some of the current and potential company clients.
